Python OOP Review Exercise 1
============================
In a new module write a class called 'NumberFun' with one property
This property will be validated as a positive integer
Write decorated methods to get and set the property
Invalid entries should default to 1
Use 'name-mangling' for the actual property

Declare a __str__ method which returns the number, the square of the number 
and the square root   ( sqrt = n**0.5 # returns square root of n )

Exercise the code to show it works as expected ( if __name__ == '__main__')
Try to access the name-mangled property directly from outside an instance of the class.
e.g.    t = myInst.__num # (should fail)
See if you can set a value for this name-mangled property
e.g.    myInst.__num = 99 # this seems to work but...

At the end, some of you may like to show what you built

Optional
--------
Write a method in your class which finds out if the integer is odd or even
Write another method which finds out if the number is itself a square number
Use these functions in your __str__ method (to say if it is odd, even, square)

Extend your class into a new class that also takes a single boolean value
If this is True, the __str__ method should also show the __dict__ of your class
